Here is TODOs and plans for future features:

1. SPECS
2. Need to deal with different templates with Tilt
3. Add checkings everywhere, where executed dangerous code like `rm` or `git checkout`
4. Add config file implementation through dot files `.tonic` and `.tonic_global` (or just `.tonic` in `~`)
5. Think about replace Shell with just backquotes - works almoust the same for my purposes, but lightweight
6. Deal with template files. Maybe another branch? Or directory. dunno
7. Draw some more nice instead of my tonic gh-page XD
