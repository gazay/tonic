Here is TODOs and plans for future features:

0. SPECS
1. Need to deal with different templates with Tilt
2. Add checkings everywhere, where executed dangerous code like `rm` or `git checkout`
3. Add config file implementation through dot files `.tonic` and `.tonic_global` (or just `.tonic` in `~`)
4. Think about replace Shell with just backquotes - works almoust the same for my purposes, but lightweight
